<b>Overview</b>: Introduce the group project by stating what the research inquiry is about, and why this is a matter of importance.
   <p class="tab"> Understanding relationships between working poverty and other variables: will do case studies to determine most significant other variables but initially looking to display info on stage in the supply chain, private property rights, or labor rights.
 </p>
<b>Methodology</b>: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.
   <p class="tab"> For this project, web mapping will articulate a special visualization of different areas of the world that have different levels of poverty.
     Within a globalization context, working poverty by country can help us understand the different correlations each country's poverty level has to supply chains, private property rights or labor rights. To capture the scale of poverty, 
    the map will not only educate others about these correlations but have a clearer view of how poverty is connected to economic inequality. </p>
<b>Workflow</b>: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.
