<b>Overview</b>: Introduce the group project by stating what the research inquiry is about, and why this is a matter of importance.
   <p class="tab"> Understanding relationships between working poverty and other variables: will do case studies to determine most significant other variables but initially looking to display info on stage in the supply chain, private property rights, or labor rights.
 </p>
<b>Methodology</b>: Introduce web mapping as a methodology of inquiry, and explain why this medium was chosen.
   <p class="tab"> For this project, web mapping will articulate a special visualization of different areas of the world that have different levels of poverty.
     Within a globalization context, working poverty by country can help us understand the different correlations each country's poverty level has to supply chains, private property rights or labor rights. To capture the scale of poverty, 
    the map will not only educate others about these correlations but have a clearer view of how poverty is connected to economic inequality. </p>
<b>Workflow</b>: Provide a workflow diagram/table that outlines the steps/phases the project will take from start to completion. Include dates/weeks as milestones.

   <p class="tab"> The scope of our project looks to explore global data.</p>
<b>Data</b>: Introduce at least two datasets that will be included in the project (include links as necessary). Make sure the data is "mappable" either by manual data entry, through an API, or by downloading it.
<ul>
<li> Our project seeks to answer the question of why some countries are poorer than others, where we focus on potential factors such as their dominant economic sectors, state of private property rights, or labor rights.  </li>
<li> We are interested in the working poverty rate which can be found in the International Labor Organization’s free labor statistics, the World Bank’s Property Rights Score to assess the state of local private property rights and the International Trade Union Confederation’s Global Rights Index to assess the local state of workers’ rights. </li>
