# Economic-Inequality
We are the Economic Inequality Group (for now, at least! We are not entirely settled on our name). We are interested in exploring the relationship between income inequality, globalization, and labor issues and want to combine web-mapping and case studies as a way to explore these connections on both global and individual levels.
