## Datasets of Interest
Our group is interested in the question of "Why are countries poor?" and we want to explore if there are correlations with the day-to-day experiences of the working class. From our research, we noticed that there were several Labor Indices that are already out there. This is great and we want to bring their findings to life. Hence, we have narrowed down our project to focus on the link between labor conditions and working poverty rates around the world. 

In terms of working poverty rates, we will be using this dataset. We wanted to narrow it down to [working poverty rates](https://www.ilo.org/shinyapps/bulkexplorer22/?lang=en&segment=indicator&id=EMP_2EMP_SEX_AGE_CLA_NB_A)  rather than poverty rates because we want our project to revolve around the experiences of people who are employed. 

The next step is to decide what labor conditions we are interested in. There is data collected by the International Labor Conditions for 25 components that collective make up their Labor Index. There is a Labor Standard which is recommended by the ILO. We are still at a crossroads of deciding which components we want to highlight. If we could construct a bouillon true/false such as to indicate whether a country even has "Minimum Wage Laws" or not, we would be able to include as many components as possible. Here is our main [reference](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_672549.pdf) for how the components are defined. Another concern we have is whether it is meaningful to compare numbers across different economic contexts. 

### Our Vision of the Site
We would use color to show the different poverty levels across countries, similar to the World Poverty Map. We would have a sidebar that lists all of the labor components we have data on. The user would click on each component, one at a time to learn more about each component. To get an overview of the labor conditions in each country, we would want each country to have a visible circle, where useres can click on to see a box with a summary of labor conditions.
