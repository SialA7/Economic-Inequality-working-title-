            <h3>Ethiopia: Humanitarian rights violation in Tigray</h3>
    
            Ethiopia is located on the easten side of the African continent. The Country is situated between Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Somali. With a population of over 118 million people it is considered the most populated landlocked country in the world and second most populated in Africa. Ethiopia became landlocked following Eritrea's independence in 1992, when Ethiopia lost its access to the Red Sea. Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995 where Meles Zenawi assumed the post of prime minister. On 12 December 2000 a peace treaty was signed to end a 30-year-old struggle with Eritrea. In an effort to help stimulate the economy, in 2004 Ethiopia started a resettlement program to move more than two million people away from parched, overworked highlands. In October 2016, a state of emergency was called that allowed restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The following year consisted of numerous protests during which hundreds of protesters were killed by security forces and tens of thousands were detained. 
            After years of widespread protests against government policies and brutal security force repression, a series of human rights reforms were ushered in after Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in April 2018. Currently, there is a dire humanitarian situation in Ethiopia after tensions with the Tigray region when a state election was deemed unconstitutional and escalated as the federal government sent in troops. Today in the Afar and Amhara regions an estimated 1.7 million people are facing food insecurity due to the spillover of the Tigray conflict. This conflict is still unfolding and could have substantial political and economic impact on Ethiopia as a country.
