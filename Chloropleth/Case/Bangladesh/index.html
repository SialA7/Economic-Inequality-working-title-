				<h3>Bangladesh: Worker incentive program to help combat food insecurity 
				</h3>
		
				Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with an estimated 171 million people with a majority of these people relying on subsistence farming to meet daily caloric needs.No Lean Season was a program that offered travel subsidies to poor rural households in Bangladesh, enabling them to send a family member into the city to work, earn money, and feed the family throughout the lean season. Lean season is the part of the year between planting and harvesting when job opportunities are scarce and incomes plummet. Initially, on a small scale, the program showed a lot of promise and successfully induced increases in migration and consumption in these households. However, certain problems were identified during the scaling up of this program that ultimately led to its closure in 2018. During the 2017 RCT conducted by Evidence Action they noted the lack of results to be a likely result of delivery constraints and mistargeting. These comments were corroborated by a Yale economist  where he commented in an interview that he hypothesized the main reason the program failed during its attempt to scale up was the loan officers were primarily concerned with meeting the quotas of the loans disbursed.In addition, there were also concerns that the program was being implemented in areas where there may not be a need anymore.The program was meant to target induced migrants, but ended up providing loans mainly to regular migrants. And since the regular migrants were those who would have migrated anyway, the program didn't end up inducing an increase in migration and ie an increase in caloric consumption.
