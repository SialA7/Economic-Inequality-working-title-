			<h3>Palm Oil Industry in Indonesia</h3>
	
			Indonesia is 22nd place for labor rights violations, with most of its violations being connected to fundamental civil liberties and the right of workers to establish and join organizations. In Indonesia, most of the working poor are living at near poverty rates, rather than moderate or extreme poverty. Currently, indonesia is a lower middle-income status economy with high income inequality rates. As the world's top producer and exporter of palm oil, we dove deeper into the industry and discovered that for workers, the industry linked to the world's top beauty brands has a hidden dark side. The dark side features invisible women working on palm oil plantations. Only the fruits of their labor are visible, while their struggles remain invisible to the general public and they see no compensation for their work. Often, women work without pay to help their husbands meet otherwise <a href = https://apnews.com/article/palm-oil-abuse-investigation-cosmetics-2a209d60c42bf0e8fcc6f8ea6daa11c7 style="color:orange">impossible daily quotas</a>.

			<h3><b>Burundi : A Complex Case of Extreme Poverty</b></h3>
			
			It is one of the poorest nations in the world. Burundi achieved independence from Belgium in 1962 and since then has struggled with an internal civil war between usually-dominant Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority. On the labor rights front, Burundi has received violations on protecting the right of workers to establish and join organizations, right to collective bargaining, and the right to strike. Despite 80% of the working population are employed in a high-value export-oriented agriculture industry, where they export gold ($90.5M), coffee ($43.9M) and tea ($23.3M) to some rich countries like the United Arab Emirates, so much of their people are still poor. One might suspect that this is another case of evil corporations exploiting poorer countries, but the socioeconomic context of extremely poor Burundi is more complex to solve by simply tightening labor rights. Most of Burundi's citizens are still farming for subsistence, there is still remnants of a civil war, and a great lack of economic diversification where the economy is fragile to external factors.

			<h3>Ethiopia: Humanitarian rights violation in Tigray</h3>
	
			Ethiopia is located on the easten side of the African continent. The Country is situated between Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Somali. With a population of over 118 million people it is considered the most populated landlocked country in the world and second most populated in Africa. Ethiopia became landlocked following Eritrea's independence in 1992, when Ethiopia lost its access to the Red Sea. Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995 where Meles Zenawi assumed the post of prime minister. On 12 December 2000 a peace treaty was signed to end a 30-year-old struggle with Eritrea. In an effort to help stimulate the economy, in 2004 Ethiopia started a resettlement program to move more than two million people away from parched, overworked highlands. In October 2016, a state of emergency was called that allowed restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The following year consisted of numerous protests during which hundreds of protesters were killed by security forces and tens of thousands were detained. 
			After years of widespread protests against government policies and brutal security force repression, a series of human rights reforms were ushered in after Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in April 2018. Currently, there is a dire humanitarian situation in Ethiopia after tensions with the Tigray region when a state election was deemed unconstitutional and escalated as the federal government sent in troops. Today in the Afar and Amhara regions an estimated 1.7 million people are facing food insecurity due to the spillover of the Tigray conflict. This conflict is still unfolding and could have substantial political and economic impact on Ethiopia as a country.

			<h3>Bangladesh: Worker incentive program to help combat food insecurity 
			</h3>
	
			Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with an estimated 171 million people with a majority of these people relying on subsistence farming to meet daily caloric needs.No Lean Season was a program that offered travel subsidies to poor rural households in Bangladesh, enabling them to send a family member into the city to work, earn money, and feed the family throughout the lean season. Lean season is the part of the year between planting and harvesting when job opportunities are scarce and incomes plummet. Initially, on a small scale, the program showed a lot of promise and successfully induced increases in migration and consumption in these households. However, certain problems were identified during the scaling up of this program that ultimately led to its closure in 2018. During the 2017 RCT conducted by Evidence Action they noted the lack of results to be a likely result of delivery constraints and mistargeting. These comments were corroborated by a Yale economist  where he commented in an interview that he hypothesized the main reason the program failed during its attempt to scale up was the loan officers were primarily concerned with meeting the quotas of the loans disbursed.In addition, there were also concerns that the program was being implemented in areas where there may not be a need anymore.The program was meant to target induced migrants, but ended up providing loans mainly to regular migrants. And since the regular migrants were those who would have migrated anyway, the program didn't end up inducing an increase in migration and ie an increase in caloric consumption.

			<h3>Mexico: Progressa policy to reduce child labor 
			</h3>
	
			Mexico is among the 15 largest economies in the world and the second largest economy in Latin America. Progressa was an innovative Mexican program that provides cash transfers to poor rural households, on condition that their children attend school and their family visits local health centers regularly. In 1998, Progresa was launched in 506 rural communities from seven states in Mexico. As a result of this program it increased school enrollment, attendance, progress through grades especially for girls. It also helped to reduce child labor by breaking the trade-off between higher consumption today and higher future consumption. The program did suffer from several issues including the quality and availability of services, political context (centralisation of education, politicization, corruption) & social norms. It also suffered from the issue of mistargeting and rising tension between neighbors that did receive the program and others that did not. Despite these issues the program was seen as successful and has helped to contribute the Mexicoâ€™s lowering poverty rate and increased workers rights.
