			According to the International Labour Organization, the working poor are employed people who live in households that fall below an accepted poverty line. Poverty is elusive to tackle in developing countries where individuals are employed but are still unable to lift themselves and their families above the poverty threshold. <br><br>
    In the pursuit of a solution, our group wants to explore whether the story of the working poor varies across countries with different standards of labor rights. If so, this points to a potential course of action that can be taken to improve their well-being.

			<!--Instructions for Final Product-->
<p style="font-size: 15 px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">There are three layers on the map to visualize how much of a country's working population are extremely poor, moderately poor or near poor in relation to the country's overall labor standards, with the saturated pink indicating high levels of working poverty, the saturated blue indicating a high labor index (and thus lower standards of work), and the saturated purple indicating that both are high. Click into a country that interests you to see a visualization of the proportions of the poverty levels of its working population. 

Hover over or click on each circle to see the name of the country, its Labor Index Score, assigned by researchers at <a href="https://www.dept.psu.edu/liberalarts/WorkersRights/about">Pennsylvania State University</a>, and the percentages of its rates of extreme, moderate, and near poverty among its working population.
<br>
<br>
We have also highlighted case studies of countries that tell interesting stories about the link between working poverty and labor rights. Featured countries are marked with an orange person icon on the map. Click on it to explore some hidden narratives.
